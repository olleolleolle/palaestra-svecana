# palaestra-svecana

This is a translation project, turning this beautiful Swedish 17th
century fencing manual into an English-Swedish diploma edition.

If you're interested to help out, please either provide translation
for a page, or a transcription of the original text.

The general structure is that for each page there's a source LaTeX
file, the exception being that pages 1 and 2 are smooshed together in
a single file.
