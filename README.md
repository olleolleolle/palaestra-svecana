# palaestra-svecana

This is a translation project, turning this beautiful Swedish 17th
century fencing manual into an Swedish-English diploma edition.

If you're interested to help out, simply clone this repo, then send a
pull request containing the transcription or translation of a single
page. Please do these on a per-page basis, to lessen the chance you're
colliding with what someone else is doing. If you spot an obvious
transcription, translation, or spelling error, feel free to either
file an issue or send a pull request.

The general structure is that for each page there's a source LaTeX
file, the exception being that pages 1 and 2 are smooshed together in
a single file.

Most pages follow "transcription in LaTeX comments, translation
follows the paragraph", for some very long paragraphs, it was easier
to do the translation intervowen with the transcription.
