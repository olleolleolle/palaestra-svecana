{\large Translator's Foreword}

This is a translation of Diederich Porath's {\it Palaestra Svecana}, a rapier fencing manual published in 1693. It has been made into a diploma edition (scans of the Swedish original text o the left, English translation on the right), both to preserve the beauty of the original work as well as making it easier to pair the (translated) text to the original illustrations.

At any point where the original text is unclear, an attempt at transcription will be present withing [square brackets]. At any point where the translator feels the need to leave a note, these will be done as side-notes\marginpar{This would be an example side-note} (primarily to preserve spatial closeness to the text the note pretains to).

The scans used are from a PDF prepared by Kungliga Biblioteket,\marginpar{ http://www.kb.se/soka/kataloger/regina?func=find-b\&request=003701203\&find_code=SYS\&local_base=KBS01} because these were the most legible scans that (so far) has been found.
