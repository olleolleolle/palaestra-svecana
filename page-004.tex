my humble effort.
To dress in a Swedish fashion the fundamentals and
rules concerning the art of fencing after the science and experience I
have gained over the years.
While I have for this been graced with the opportunity to woo His
Royal Majesty and after that been given the chance to be the first to
lay a rapier in Your Royal Highness's hands. So that I was given the
opportunity to show what I had previously only described and
contribute to the rigour and joy that Your Royal Highness to this
knightly practice always have shown.

Wherefore I place this well-meaning work before Your Royal Highness's
feet in deepest humility and also most humbly ask Yuor Royal Highness
to see this as a sign of my most humble duty with the most forgiving
eyes. I have not been able to spend my time and endeavours in a better
way than this goal set before me. If I only am so lucky as to have
done something to the service and benevolent joy of Your Royal
Highness, in which I trust that I after my unchanging necessity and
most humble submission until my death remains.

Yor Royal Highness

Stockholm, the 30th \\
September, 1693

Your ever-humble servant \\
